Implement Marsaglia KISS generators
Implement Mersenne Twister and related SFMT
Implement WELL algorithm
To check: should seeds be declared as static?
Implement unit tests and automatic test script
Implement seeding routines, taking take to avoid "bad" seeds
Implement parallel streams and "jumping ahead"
  - First need to implement state structures for each generator
Possibly implement other RNGs, including Park-Miller and RANLUX

Add support for Windows systems, using something like

  #ifdef _MSC_VER

  typedef __int32 int32_t;
  typedef unsigned __int32 uint32_t;
  typedef __int64 int64_t;
  typedef unsigned __int64 uint64_t;

  #else
  #include <stdint.h>
  #endif

but more comprehensive.
